# ChameleonCrypt

The following implementation was created for my master thesis. It demonstrates a cryptographic protocol combining Time-Lock Encryption (TLE) and Chameleon Hashing, built on top of pairing-based cryptography. The solution showcases how access to encrypted data can be delayed until specific conditions are met—in this case, the successful reconstruction of a secret key from multiple distributed shares using Shamir’s Secret Sharing. The AES encryption key is derived through a bilinear pairing operation followed by hashing, ensuring cryptographic strength and control.

The implementation also integrates a Chameleon Hash function, which enables controlled collisions for auditability and verifiable message modification. This functionality proves especially useful in trust-managed environments, where traceable yet flexible document handling is required. The system was developed using the JPBC cryptographic library and serves as a foundational module for future integration with Hyperledger Fabric, where similar logic will be extended into a blockchain-based smart contract environment for secure, traceable, and delayed-access data management.
